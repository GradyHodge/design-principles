                Hick's Law (or the Hick–Hyman Law) says that the more choices you present to your users, the longer it takes them to reach a decision. However, combining Hick’s Law with other design techniques can make long menus easy to use.

                The Porche website combines several menus and decisions to make based on other lists without the user feeling overwhelmed with their choices.
                The use of images, icons, slide bars, and white space as part of the menu selection prevents the user from becoming overwhelmed and opens up the process of customizing the users product.

                Basically, you draw a tic-tac-toe style grid over your image or layout.  Your points of interest should fall on these lines or where the lines intersect.
